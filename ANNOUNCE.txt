========================
 Announcing Numexpr 2.1
========================

Numexpr is a fast numerical expression evaluator for NumPy.  With it,
expressions that operate on arrays (like "3*a+4*b") are accelerated
and use less memory than doing the same calculation in Python.

It wears multi-threaded capabilities, as well as support for Intel's
VML library (included in Intel MKL), which allows an extremely fast
evaluation of transcendental functions (sin, cos, tan, exp, log...)
while squeezing the last drop of performance out of your multi-core
processors.

Its only dependency is NumPy (MKL is optional), so it works well as an
easy-to-deploy, easy-to-use, computational kernel for projects that
don't want to adopt other solutions that require more heavy
dependencies.

What's new
==========

This version adds compatibility for Python 3.  Many thanks to Antonio Valentino
for his fine work on this.

In case you want to know more in detail what has changed in this
version, see:

or have a look at RELEASE_NOTES.txt in the tarball.

Where I can find Numexpr?
=========================

You can get the packages from PyPI as well:
